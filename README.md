 Function requirements
1. User Registration and Authentication:

	- Secure authentication mechanisms to ensure user privacy and data security.

2. Data Collection:
	- Ability to fetch and collect data from various e-commerce websites.
	- Realtime scrap data according to the user search

3. Item Comparison:
	- Users can select and compare specific items from different e-commerce platforms.
	- Display detailed specifications, prices, and other relevant information for each item.
	- Implement NLP module for deciding how we can compare products

4. Search and Filter:
	- A robust search functionality allowing users to find specific items.
	- Filters to narrow down options based on various criteria (price range, brand, ratings, etc.).

5. Bookmarking or Wishlist:
    - Allow users to save and compare items later.
    - Implement a wishlist feature for users to save preferred items.


 Future enhancement 
1. In store details related to purticular product
	- For this we have to access location or details related to local area
	- Then we will show the near by shop details like price etc

TODO:
SRS - Software requirement Specifications - next week
Think of something new algorithm or idea which we can implement rather than only fetching the data and displaying it

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
